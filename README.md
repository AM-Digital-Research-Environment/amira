# AMIRA — Africa Multiple Interactive Research Atlas

Interactive research atlas for the [Africa Multiple Cluster of Excellence](https://www.africamultiple.uni-bayreuth.de/), exposing the cluster's WissKI/MongoDB archive as a browsable, analysable, visually-rich web app. Built with SvelteKit 5, ECharts 6, MapLibre GL 5, and Tailwind CSS 4 — shipped as an installable static PWA to GitHub Pages.

**Live:** <https://am-digital-research-environment.github.io/amira/>

## Scope

- **3,975** research items across **92** projects
- **1,394** persons, **492** institutions, **84** groups
- **13** research sections — 6 Phase 1 (Affiliations, Arts & Aesthetics, Knowledges, Learning, Mobilities, Moralities), 6 Phase 2 (Accumulation, Digitalities, Ecologies, In/securities, Re:membering, Translating), and an "External" pseudo-section
- 4 partner universities (Bayreuth lead + UNILAG, UJKZ, Moi, Rhodes) plus 1 privileged partner (UFBA's CEAO, Salvador de Bahia)
- 2 external collections (BayGlo2025, ILAM)
- **Per-entity detail dashboards** for languages, subjects, tags, people, institutions, genres, resource types, groups, locations, research sections, and projects — all backed by precomputed JSON dumps under `static/data/entity_dashboards/`

## Features

### Dashboard

- **Overview** — summary stat cards (items, projects, contributors, institutions, languages, countries, subjects/tags), a cluster-locations MiniMap showing the geographic reach of the partnership, a featured-collections sneak-peek grid, global filter panel (resource type, language, university), stacked timeline by type, resource-type pie, subject bar chart, tag word cloud, research-section distribution, and a Research Section × University heatmap matrix. Phase 1 sections chart separately from Phase 2 (which begins June 2026).
- **What's New** — recent additions within a selectable window (3 / 6 / 12 months): top projects by new-item count, list of the most recent items, and a quick pivot into the detail views.

### Research

- **Research Sections** — the 13 sections with full descriptions, objectives, work programmes, spokespeople / PIs, members, and project Gantt timelines. Phase 1 sections show project charts; Phase 2 sections surface spokesperson info only (no projects until June 2026). Each section also opens an `EntityDashboard` of stacked timeline, resource type / language / subject breakdowns, decade heatmap, subject trends, time-aware chord, contributor network, and origin → current geo flows.
- **Projects** — faceted browser (research section, institution) with detail views showing description, PIs, members, institutions, paginated items, and WissKI links. Overview adds a Gantt timeline, beeswarm (projects by section and year, sized by item count), and bar charts for sections and institutions. Per-project detail pages now ship the full Phase 4 dashboard: stacked timeline, type / language / role pies, subjects bar, word cloud, type × decade heatmap, subject trends, sunburst, chord + time-aware chord, sankey, contributor network, geo flows, locations map, and knowledge graph.
- **Research Items** — full-text search and collapsible facets (subject, tag, country, project, language, resource type) over all 3,975 items, with a sortable table view. Detail view exposes title, abstract, contributors (role-qualified persons / institutions / groups), subjects (LCSH), tags, origin locations on a MiniMap, dates, language, identifiers, project, and a per-item entity knowledge graph with fullscreen mode. Below the detail card you'll find a `SiblingItemsSparkline` (year-by-year project timeline with the current item highlighted) and a `SimilarItemsStrip` (top-8 semantic-kNN matches via Gemini embeddings).

### Collections

- **Featured Collections** — curated showcase of photography and multimedia collections. Detail pages offer three synchronised views of the same deduped item set:
  - **Masonry** — responsive photo grid that reshuffles on resize and opens items in a photo lightbox (keyboard nav, metadata sidebar, deep-link to WissKI).
  - **Map** — MapLibre GL cluster map of capture locations with SPA-routed popups.
  - **Timeline** — chronological stacked view with zoom and type breakdown.
  - Faceted filters (creator, subject, tag, country, year), WebP thumbnails shipped with the build for fast first paint, and deduped `alias` counts for photos that appear in multiple records.
  - **History-aware navigation** — tab switches push to browser history and the open photo is mirrored to the URL (`?photo=…`), so browser Back closes the lightbox and steps through tab changes instead of jumping to the collections list.

### Directory and Categories — unified card-based browse + per-entity dashboards

All directory and category pages (**People**, **Groups**, **Institutions**, **Genres**, **Languages**, **Locations**, **Resource Types**, **Subjects & Tags**) share a consistent card-grid layout backed by reusable components (`EntityCard`, `EntityBrowseGrid`, `EntityToolbar`, `EntityDetailHeader`, `EntityItemsCard`) and utilities (`applyEntitySort`). Each card shows the entity name, descriptor, icon, count with label ("items", "projects", etc.), and type-specific meta chips; pages use a single toolbar with full-text search, count / alphabetical sort toggles, and a results badge. The grid paginates at 48 cards per page to keep long lists (1,000+ subjects, tags, cities) fast.

Detail views are opened via URL query params (e.g. `/people?name=John%20Doe`, `/genres?genre=Broadcast`) and the selection is driven by a writable `$derived` over `$page.url.searchParams` — so browser Back automatically clears the detail view and restores the card grid, deep links are shareable, and reload preserves state.

Each entity detail page now mounts an `<EntityDashboard>` populated from a precomputed per-entity JSON file. Layouts are declared in [`entityDashboardLayouts.ts`](src/lib/components/dashboards/entityDashboardLayouts.ts); slots auto-hide when their payload is empty, so the grid never carries placeholder cards.

#### Directory

- **People** — affiliation filter (searchable combobox), role filter, "hide empty" toggle, and rich profile views with research sections, projects (as PI or member), affiliations, a per-person dashboard (stacked timeline, resource types / languages / roles, top subjects, co-credited persons chord, projects + co-contributors network, affiliated institutions network, locations), paginated items with a per-item role badge, and a collaboration & influence knowledge graph.
- **Groups** — research groups and organisational units that author items, with per-group dashboards (timeline, types, languages, subjects, members & collaborators, locations) and knowledge graph.
- **Institutions** — partner / contributor filter toggle, per-institution dashboard (stacked timeline, types / languages, top subjects, affiliated contributors, contributor + affiliation networks, locations), projects (with PIs, dates, sections), people, items, and knowledge graph.

#### Categories

- **Genres** — MARC genre classification with a top-20 bar chart, a genre × language heatmap, and a card grid; per-genre detail pages include the standard `EntityDashboard` (timeline, types / languages, subjects, contributors, locations).
- **Languages** — ISO 639-2/3 codes rendered as full English names throughout. List page adds a stacked-area timeline and a language × resource-type heatmap; per-language detail pages render a 9-card dashboard plus a country choropleth.
- **Locations** — country / region / city browser with a **MapLibre GL browse map on top of the list** (markers coloured by type, clickable popups that SPA-route into the detail page), a country choropleth, top-cities bar, and tagged-items timeline. Each location detail shows a self-location MiniMap, the standard dashboard, and the knowledge graph.
- **Resource Types** — text, sound recording, still image, moving image, cartographic, mixed material, etc., with pie and bar charts, a stacked-area timeline, and a type × language heatmap; per-type detail pages render a full dashboard with subject trends.
- **Subjects & Tags** — toggle between LCSH controlled vocabulary and free-form tags, unified tag icon across both views, animated word cloud (up to 200 terms, adjustable size) with click-through, plus subject-trends overlay and an LCSH-vs-tag pie. Per-subject / per-tag detail pages add a co-subject network and the standard dashboard.

### Visualize

- **Project Explorer** — cross-project analytical workspace with section / project selectors and synchronised charts.
- **Compare** — single page (`/compare/[type]`) with a tab bar that switches among **projects**, **people**, **institutions**, **subjects**, **languages**, and **genres**. Every type renders the same primitives — stat row, 6-axis profile radar, shared-subjects chips, side-by-side stacked timelines + resource-type pies + top-subjects bars + language bars + contributor bars — with the data source swapped per type. `/compare/projects` covers university × project filters via on-the-fly aggregation off the loaded collections; the other types load precomputed entity-dashboard JSON. The legacy `/compare-projects` URL still works as a redirect to `/compare/projects`.
- **Network** — five interactive force-directed graph tabs, all weighted (edge thickness = strength of tie) and community-coloured:
  - **Contributors ↔ Projects** — weighted bipartite graph; edge width equals the number of items a person contributed to that project
  - **Co-authorship** — person ↔ person projection of the contributor graph, edges for pairs with ≥ 2 shared items
  - **People ↔ Institutions** — bipartite affiliations view
  - **Institution collaborations** — institutions joined when they share people on the same project
  - **Discursive communities** — Louvain communities detected across the whole archive, with the top-PageRank anchor of each cluster, built from the precomputed `_meta.json`
  - Filters: university, max nodes, resource type
- **Semantic Map** — 2D UMAP projection of Gemini-embedded item vectors. Scatter colourable by university, resource type, language, or research section; searchable and filterable; click a point to see the item and its top-12 cosine-similar neighbours. Similar-items payload is lazy-loaded on first selection.

### Cross-linking, WissKI, PWA, and SEO

Every named entity is a link:

- PIs, members, and contributors → People (persons) or Institutions / Groups (by qualifier)
- Project names → project detail
- Item titles → item detail + knowledge graph
- Section badges → section detail
- Institution badges → institutions page
- Language badges → languages page
- Location origins (city / region / country) → locations page
- Resource-type badges → resource types page
- Subject and tag badges → subjects & tags page

**WissKI Navigate** — Optional deep-links to WissKI entities surface throughout the dashboard via pre-computed URL mappings (`dev.wisski_urls.*.json`), connecting every dashboard record back to its source in the WissKI knowledge base.

**Chart downloads** — Every ECharts visualisation exposes a download button in its card header that exports the chart as a PNG with the card title, subtitle, and export date composited on top, using the site's typography and theme (light or dark).

**PWA** — The site ships a Web App Manifest ([`static/manifest.json`](static/manifest.json)) and a service worker ([`src/service-worker.js`](src/service-worker.js)) so it installs as a standalone app on desktop and mobile, with offline shell and shortcuts to What's New / Projects / Research Items / Network. Theme colour, maskable icons, and orientation hints are all set.

**SEO** — Every route ships a `<SEO>` component that emits Open Graph + Twitter Card tags and a canonical URL; the build also pre-renders [`/sitemap.xml`](src/routes/sitemap.xml/+server.ts) covering both static routes and every entity-detail URL discovered by scanning `static/data/entity_dashboards/`.

**Mobile UX** — The whole app is touch-friendly on a phone: pagination controls scroll the list back into view on tap, stat cards stack with sensible truncation, the Gantt timeline collapses to a vertical list, empty states render at full card width, and the sidebar slides over the content rather than reflowing it.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev           # dev server
npm run build         # production build
npm run preview       # preview production build
npm run check         # svelte-kit sync + svelte-check
npm run lint          # ESLint
npm run format        # Prettier write
npm run format:check  # Prettier check (CI uses this)
```

CI runs `format:check`, so run `npm run format` locally before committing if the check fails.

## Data Sources

### MongoDB exports — `static/data/dev/`

- **`dev.projectsData.json`** — 92 projects with PIs, members, dates, research sections, institutions, RDSpace references
- **`dev.persons.json`** — 1,394 person records with institutional affiliations
- **`dev.institutions.json`** — 492 institution records
- **`dev.groups.json`** — 84 research-group records
- **`dev.collections.json`** — development-only collection items
- **`dev.researchSections.json`** — all 13 research sections (Phase 1 + Phase 2 + External)
- **`dev.geo.json`** — country / region / subregion / city geolocations with Wikidata coordinates
- **`dev.wisski_urls.*.json`** — pre-computed WissKI navigate URL mappings for every entity type (projects, persons, institutions, items, subjects, tags, countries, regions, cities, genres, groups, languages, research sections, resource types)

### Partner-university collections — `static/data/projects_metadata_*/`

3,975 research items across four partners. Each item carries title, contributors (person / institution / group qualifier with roles), subjects (LCSH), tags, language (ISO 639-2/3), location (country / region / city), dates (created, issued, captured), identifiers, physical description, access conditions, and bitstream / URL references.

### External collections — `static/data/external_metadata/`

Items contributed from outside the cluster's partner universities. Tagged `university: "external"` so they count toward global totals but can be filtered out of per-university views:

- **`BayGlo2025`** — Bayreuth Global / Bayreuth Postkolonial; affiliated with the University of Bayreuth
- **`ILAM`** — International Library of African Music (Rhodes University)

Surfaced across the dashboard as virtual projects (`Ext_BayGlo2025`, `Ext_ILAM`) under an **External** pseudo research section, with a dedicated chip in the global filter panel and a dedicated group in the Project Explorer and Compare selectors. Virtual-project definitions live in [`src/lib/utils/external.ts`](src/lib/utils/external.ts).

### Entity dashboards — `static/data/entity_dashboards/`

Pre-computed JSON dumps powering the per-entity detail pages and the `/compare/[type]` selectors. One file per entity instance, organised by directory:

```
entity_dashboards/
├── manifest.json                # `{ <dir>: [{id, name, count}, ...] }`
├── languages/{code}.json        # 28 entries
├── subjects/{slug}.json         # 620 entries
├── tags/{slug}.json             # 1,100 entries
├── people/{slug}.json           # 1,174 entries
├── institutions/{slug}.json     # 459 entries
├── genres/{slug}.json           # 129 entries
├── resource-types/{slug}.json   # 11 entries
├── groups/{slug}.json           # 84 entries
├── locations/{slug}.json        # 252 entries
├── research-sections/{slug}.json # 6 entries
└── projects/{id}.json           # 38 entries
```

Each JSON contains all the chart payloads needed to render its entity's dashboard (`timeline`, `stackedTimeline`, `types`, `languages`, `subjects`, `wordCloud`, `contributors`, `roles`, `heatmap`, `chord`, `coContributors`, `coSubjects`, `sankey`, `sunburst`, `treemap`, `subjectTrends`, `locations`, `selfLocation`, `geoFlows`, `contributorNetwork`, `affiliationNetwork`, `collabNetwork`, `meta`, `items`). Generated by [`scripts/precompute_entity_dashboards.py`](scripts/precompute_entity_dashboards.py); the loader lives at [`src/lib/utils/loaders/entityDashboardLoader.ts`](src/lib/utils/loaders/entityDashboardLoader.ts).

### Knowledge graphs — `static/data/knowledge_graphs/`

Structural ego graphs pre-computed by [`scripts/generate_knowledge_graphs.py`](scripts/generate_knowledge_graphs.py) — one JSON file per entity organised by type:

```
knowledge_graphs/
├── _meta.json            # Global community labels + top-PageRank nodes
├── items/                # Research-item ego graphs
├── persons/
├── projects/
├── institutions/
├── subjects/
├── tags/
├── locations/
└── genres/
```

Each graph combines **direct** metadata edges (IDF-weighted so distinctive relationships look heavier than ubiquitous ones), **latent** structural edges (Jaccard on shared neighbourhoods + personalised PageRank for multi-hop relevance), and global analysis results (Louvain community membership, PageRank-based centrality) so the UI can reveal discursive communities and key nodes that local co-occurrence alone would miss.

### Embeddings — `static/data/embeddings/`

- **`map.json`** — per-item `{id, x, y, lowSignal, title, project, university, typeOfResource}` for the 2D UMAP scatter
- **`similar.json`** — per-item top-12 cosine-similar neighbours keyed by `dre_id` (lazy-loaded on first selection on `/semantic-map`, also consumed by `SimilarItemsStrip` on `/research-items?id=…`)
- `cache.json` — full 768-dim Gemini vectors + SHA-256 hashes used for incremental re-embedding; gitignored

Pipelined by [`scripts/generate_embeddings.py`](scripts/generate_embeddings.py). See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for details.

### Geographic data — `static/data/geo/`

- **`world-countries-110m.json`** — Natural Earth 110m country boundaries (TopoJSON) used by `ChoroplethMap`. Bundled once with the build; smaller than the 50m / 10m datasets at the cost of coastline detail.

### Manual data — `static/data/manual/`

Hand-curated data not sourced from MongoDB:

- `projectLinks.json` — supplementary project-to-entity links

## Scripts

Python pipelines live in [`scripts/`](scripts/) and cover MongoDB export, WissKI URL generation, thumbnail fetching, knowledge-graph generation, embedding generation, per-entity dashboard precompute, and data slimming. Setup:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

Key scripts (see [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for the full list and inputs / outputs):

- **`fetch_from_mongodb.py`** — pull research items + reference data from the WissKI MongoDB
- **`generate_wisski_urls.py`** — emit pre-computed `dev.wisski_urls.*.json` lookups for the WissKI Navigate links
- **`fetch_thumbnails.py`** — download remote `previewImage` URLs as local WebP thumbnails so the first paint doesn't hit the public archive
- **`generate_knowledge_graphs.py`** — compute the ego-graph JSON consumed by `EntityKnowledgeGraph` and `/network?tab=communities`
- **`generate_embeddings.py`** — run Gemini Embedding 2 over the corpus, project to 2D with UMAP, emit `map.json` + `similar.json`
- **`precompute_entity_dashboards.py`** — generate one JSON per entity under `static/data/entity_dashboards/`, plus the global manifest. Supports `--from-local`, per-type runs, and `--dry-run`. The manifest writer merges with the existing file so a single-entity run doesn't wipe the others' entries
- **`slim_data.py`** — strip development-only fields before shipping production data

Regenerate everything after a metadata refresh:

```bash
.venv/Scripts/python scripts/generate_knowledge_graphs.py
.venv/Scripts/python scripts/generate_embeddings.py --scope missing
.venv/Scripts/python scripts/precompute_entity_dashboards.py --entity all --from-local
```

## Deployment

Deploys automatically to GitHub Pages on push to `main`:

- **Workflow:** [.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) — `npm ci` → `npm run build` with `BASE_PATH=/${{ github.event.repository.name }}` → `actions/upload-pages-artifact` → `actions/deploy-pages`
- **Adapter:** [`@sveltejs/adapter-static`](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-static) pre-renders every route into `build/`
- **Live URL:** <https://am-digital-research-environment.github.io/amira/>
- **CI:** [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) runs `npm run format:check`, `npm run lint`, `npm run check`, and `npm run build` on every push and PR
